# my-first-vue-deploy
Repo for deploy the content I've worked on VueMastery course.

Link of the deployed site:
https://eventsvue.onrender.com/

I developed alterations on the code avaible at https://www.vuemastery.com/courses/real-world-vue3/
I do not own the idea for the app and I'm using it under educational purposes only.
